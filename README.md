# 📚 Library Management System API

A RESTful backend API for managing a library — built with **NestJS**, **TypeORM**, and **PostgreSQL**. Supports user registration with OTP verification, role-based access control, subscription-based book borrowing, and a full borrow/return request lifecycle.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** NestJS (Node.js + TypeScript)
- **ORM:** TypeORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Auth:** JWT (access token via cookies) + OTP email verification
- **File uploads:** Multer (book cover images)
- **Email:** Nodemailer
- **Scheduling:** @nestjs/schedule (OTP expiry cleanup)
- **Validation:** class-validator + class-transformer

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Hojiakbarxon/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your values (see Environment Variables section)

# 4. Start the server
npm run start:dev
```

---

## 🗃️ Database Setup

After starting the server for the first time (TypeORM `synchronize: true` will auto-create all tables), you must run the SQL files in the `database/` folder manually to seed required data.

**Step 1 — Run the seed files in order:**

```bash
# Connect to your database
psql -U postgres -d library_db

# Then run each file inside the database/ folder
\i database/insert-into-table-roles.sql
\i database/insert-into-table-status.sql
# run any other .sql files present in that folder
```

Or paste the contents directly into psql shell / pgAdmin query tool.

**Step 2 — Create the SuperAdmin manually:**

After seeding, insert the SuperAdmin user directly into the database. First hash a password using bcrypt (rounds: 10), then run:

```sql
INSERT INTO "user" (full_name, email, login, password, "roleId")
VALUES (
  'Super Admin',
  'superadmin@example.com',
  'superadmin',
  '<bcrypt_hashed_password>',
  1  -- role id 1 = SUPERADMIN (check your roles table)
);
```

> ⚠️ Never create the SuperAdmin through the API — there is no public endpoint for it by design. All other admins are created by SuperAdmin via `POST /users/admin`.

## 👥 Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `SUPERADMIN` | Full access — manages admins, subscriptions, and all data |
| `ADMIN` | Manages books, authors, genres, and handles borrow requests |
| `USER` | Registers, buys subscriptions, requests and returns books |

> SuperAdmin accounts are created manually or seeded. Admins are created by SuperAdmin via `POST /users/admin`. Users register via `POST /auth/register`.

## 🔐 Authentication

All endpoints except auth routes require a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header.

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|

### Borrow Flow

```
User: POST /requests/buy  { books_ids: [1, 2] }
         → status: PENDING, purpose: BORROW, book quantity decremented

Admin: POST /requests/accept-request/:id
         → status: APPROVED, user_book record created

         OR

Admin: POST /requests/reject-request/:id
         → status: REJECTED, book quantity restored
```

### Return Flow

```
User: POST /requests/return-request/:userBookId
         → new Request with status: PENDING, purpose: RETURN

Admin: POST /requests/accept-request/:id
         → status: APPROVED, user_book closed, book quantity restored

         OR

Admin: POST /requests/reject-request/:id
         → status: REJECTED (user keeps the book)
```

## 📦 User Books

Tracks which books are currently borrowed by which users. Records are created internally when a borrow request is approved — not directly by the frontend.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/user-books` | View all borrow records | ADMIN, SUPERADMIN |
| GET | `/user-books/my-books` | View my borrowed books (active + returned) | USER |

> The `is_active` field indicates whether the book is still borrowed (`true`) or returned (`false`). The `returned_at` timestamp is filled when returned.
